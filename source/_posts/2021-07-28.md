# 2021-07-28

## Song of ..<AM>

How long must I wait?

The hopes that I chase

whether it's too late

If my bird ` has flown` away?

The dreamer you've been

Your little girl has become

What should I do?

Your plan `fell throught` for you

But I must believe in myself

But I must believe in myself

Don't say goodbye

Two bird are flying hight

And I must leave on a wind for a few

Dangerous  and lonely times there may be

She is forever asking will she leave

Is this what a dreamer should feel?

Say goodbye to my `drab` and `passive` days right now

You've found the gem in me

There

`present perfect` 现在完成时

`as of` 自...起
