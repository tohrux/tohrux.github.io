# Into the Sky <MODv>

Do you feel alone?

Can you hear me now?

Your mind is so far away still on the earth

Many times you are hurting yourself

You can't be just a life on the shelf

It's only you that can fly this new unicorn

Into the sky

And It's every time, you hurt yourself with knives

And I'm calling calling out your name again

If you're holding holding onto fear I knew

the blind can open,let light shine through

And I say 

Why we can't stop all this `sacrifice`

I know that all the lies became the stone in your heart

I wonder how long you gonna survive

We didn't see all it's meaning

You are the one for me

Finally I can see

Can you promise me you'll come back safe and help me ?

I'm `counting on you` to bring the peace we all deserve

And maybe we'll be able to continue
